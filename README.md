# OpenUSD Notes  

These are short revision notes I compiled while learning **OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description)**.  
They provide a quick reference on core topics such as stages, prims, layers, composition, Hydra rendering,  
file formats, and Python APIs.  

The purpose is fast revision before **interviews, exams, or practical work** in  
**NVIDIA Omniverse, Isaac Sim, or general 3D/graphics pipelines**.
